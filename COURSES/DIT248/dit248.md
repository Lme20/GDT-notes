# INTRODUCTION TO GAME RESEARCH - DIT248

## LECTURE 1
### RESEARCH
- deal with knowledge gap, gather "evidence"
- Support your position (refences and rhetoric)
- Communicate your results
- In order to say something new, you need to mention and know what everyone else has said
- Understand the "state of the art" of a game
- 

#### TACKLE RESEARCH
- start with a research question, usually within a problem or research domain 
- Critical, systemic, experiential aspects of a game. "what is the messaging?"

### WHAT ARE GAMES?
- consider the difference between gaming and playing
- play: open-ended, no predefined structured
- gaming: structured and confined within formal or semi-formal systems

### MODEL OF GAMES
- Crawford and kostler
- Suits
- Esposito
- Jesper 
- Jankko stenros

### NON-GAMES
- a formal system that is not game
- e.g. the "education system", the stock market, software development

- we can apply discussed tools and techniques to understand these systems

### CRITICAL EVALUTION OF GAMES
- what is the game saying?
- through themes
- mechanical designs? 
- story? 
- setting? 
- character design? 
- construction of time and space? 
- messaging
- is the mesage positive/negative

### BARRETT'S PRINCIPLES OF INTERPRETATION

- 18 key principles that direct critic towards games
- feelings are your guide to intepretation
- a game isn't about what the makers make it out to be, it's about the player's response
- The interactivity of a game should not be ignored
- all games are in part about other games
- good interpretation is about relationships

### WHAT RELATIONSHIPS EXIST? 
- ludonarrative dissonance
- the relationship of a game with other games of a similar family
- between a game and a real or imagined political context
- between a game and a difficult topic 
- how the game engages with of the historicity subject matter
- how an aethetic triggers an emotional reponse

### TERMS/CONCEPTS
- Ludonarrative dissonance
- the death of the author
- New Game Journalism
- Unreliable narrator
- Diegetic: e.g. dialogue
- non-diegetic: e.g. user interface
- Games as art
- Games as social commentary

### TO CONSIDER
- There's no special way to tackle interpretation, it needs you to make you think 
- It is always subjective (all about rhetoric and persuasion)

## ONLINE SESSION 1

## LECTURE 3  - experiential perspective

- Users play a role in shaping game experience
- games have been an experimental medium in terms of player agency
- players are directly implicated in what a character does

- "the magic circle" (concept)
    * what happens within the "magic circle" is philosophically, emotionally, and morally disconneted from what happens outside of it, except we need to consider actions that may cross over the boundaries we migt hope are inviolable 
    * this concept is porous in the context of social contexts (cheating, griefing, betrayal, indifference, etc)
- Morality systems: 'morality systems' are often present in games, where the game changes based on what the player does within the narrative
    * There can be pervasive games, where the boundaries of the 'magic circle' are less clear

- most morality systems are 'utilitarian' in that they asses 'goodness' and 'badness' based on outcome
    * 'rightness' is assessed in terms of how harm is maximised or minimised
    * deontology codes
    * most systems can be summarised as 'karma metters'
    * Some systems are thematic, or encourage replayability
    * Other systems create a sense of ownership on a narrative
    * Or to create a sense of ownership over the character

- Karma meters:
    * tendency to create 'cartoonish scenarios'
    * Games with morality systems often offer binary choices

- Ultima IV is a good example of a game implementing a less pragmatic approach to game morality
- Papers, please (2013)
- Spec Ops: the line (2012)

- Constraints in morality systems: 
    * they are reductive, they reduce the options a player can choose
    * they need to be coded, which can open challenges in development
    * can create cartoonish situations
    * does not mirror the randomness and complexity of real-life choices

- In a wider context, what is seen in a game is always a compromise, business constraints, development constraints, societal contests and time constraints take a huge role. 

- Accessibility: an important aspect of games
    * economic factors
    * societal factors
    * emotional factors

## LECTURE 4  - Systemic perspective


## LECTURE 5  - History of games TODO

- What is a genre? 

- Why do genres matter? 

- Intertexuality

- Genres:
    * Sports games:
    * Strategy: 
    * Puzzle
    * Simulations
    * Real-time strategy games
    * Racing games
    * Platforming games
    * CRPGS
    * Adventure games
    * First-person shooter
    * 


## LECTURE 6 - Tabletop roleplaying games

- What is an RPG?

- Where it began
    * Kreigsspel 
        * Chess is mainly deterministic, while most training games were stochastic
    * Little Wars (1913)
    * Miniature Wargames
        * game by mail
    * Avalon hell
    * Gary Gygax (DND pioneer)
    * Dungeons and Dragons
        * Early features
        * 
    * RPG example: Ars Magica (1987)
    * RPG example: Dread (2006)
        * Good example of a game reaching across the 'magic circle'
    * RPG example: Blades in the Dark
    * Gurps: 
    * Cyberpunk red: 
- Public perception
- Social contracts
- Safety tools
- Live Action Roleplaying games (LARP) 
    * Diagetic consistency
    * Example games: 
        * Empire LARP
        * Conquest of mythodea
        * Monitor celestra
- Megagames
    * The system has already won
    * Rebel country
    * Light the skies
    * The Pirate republic

- Solo-journaling RPGS

- Models for analysing RPGS
    * 
- LARP mixing desk 
- GNS Framework 
- RPGS as moddable systems

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS

Examples:
The witness: How can a game be designed to allow a huge variety in puzzle experience from a single puzzle design
Black myth: wukong: How faithfully does this game interpret the original source, and what concessions does it make to modern sensibilities
The sims: what are some of the important cultural assumptions men and women have about the Sims 
Tabletop simulator: How is the tactility of playing a board game impacted by the translation into tabletop simulator
Stray gods: How does the changing music in the game influence the way people respond to the story 
Unpacking: How does the environmental design in unpacking work to tell us a story about the relationship of the protagonist 
Undertale: What is the genre literacy required in order to fully appreciate the structure of undertale
Exit: what is the environmental impact of an exit escape room in comparison to the unlock games. 
Terraforming mars: what is the central message regarding the role of corporations in terraforming planets as expressed in terraforming mars. 

### IDEAS:

- How does Procedural Content Generation in a Game Impact its Playability? 
- In What Way do Sandbox games like 'Minecraft' and 'Space Engine' Allow for Player Creativity? 
- What aspects of Open World Games are Crucial for Their playability?

## WRITING PAPER

    1. should provide all the required context for the question
        * Intertextual comparisons
        * Show how others have talked about the game
        * Show how others have answered similar questions
        * Include important litterature for context on your approach
    2. Select the approach for your litterature review
        * argumentative
        * integrative
        * historical
        * methodological
        * systematic
        * theoretical
        * cultural
    3. Build credibility
        * Refence statements/ citations 
    4. Discussions


    On the crafting mechanics in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, how has this system impacted playability and what leads it to be used outside its intended use?
