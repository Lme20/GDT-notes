# Gameplay design

## L1 - Introduction and definitions of games

### The role of game designers

- "Advocate for the player" Have a clear vision of target group
- Providing goof gameplay: creating ideas, ensuring quality
- Making sure that intendended gameplay is achieved
- Project leader
- Skills of game designers: communication, writing, speaking, compromising, extensive knowledge of games/gameplay, finding ideas, inspiration

### A player oriented design process

- involve players, "player-oriented but system-based"
- Iterative design process: setting initial goal, developing and refining, evaluating against initial design goal
- What is designed is a system
- Alternative approaches exist

### Definitions of Games

- D. Palett: distinguishes between formal/informal games - The Oxford History of Boardgames, 1999
- C. C. Abt, Serious Games 1970
- J. Huizinga, Homo Ludens, 1938: "Magic circle"
- R. Caillois, Man, Play and Games: governed by rules, categories, unproductive, Uncertain, separate time and space, free
- C. Crawford, The Art of Computer Game Design "a closed formal system"
- B. Suits Grasshoper: Games, Life, and Utopia (1990)
- G. Costikyan, I have no words and I must design
- E. Avedon & B.Stutton-Smith, The study of Games
- J.Von Neumann & O.Morgenstern "Theory of Games and economic behaviour"
- T.Fullerton, C.Swain and S.Hoffman - Game Design Workshop
- a form of reality in a smaller scale
- K. Salen & E.Zimmerman: Rules of Play
- J. Juul's model of classical games

Broadly, games could be considered as transmedial

All the definitions have been presented in english

Not all definitions define games

## L2 - Understanding games and gameplay

### Gameplay Systems

"set of interacting or interdependent entities"

- system: objects, properties, behaviors, relationships
- open and closed systems: exchange of something, agents of exchange, methods of exchange (actions)

you can in many instances view game systems as "economies"

- can be viewed as a state machine (initial, end, goal)
- Events (or rules): update state, can be initiated through actions by players or previous events

Emergent systems generate an unpredictible pattern of complexity

- coupled and context-dependent
- feedback loops can be emergent features

Games as cybernetic systems "the science of communication and control theory that is concerned especially with the comparative study of automatic control systems"

- sensor, comparator, activator
- negative and positive feedback loop
- negative feedback: balancing effects, prolongs the game, magnifies successes
- positive feedback: shortens the game, destabilizes the game, minimizes successes
- feedback systems can take away control from players

### Design languages

- allows designers to embed eaning into artefacts
- allows artefacts to express meaning to people
- allows artefacts to be assimilated into peoples' lives
- components: collection of elements, organization principles, qualifying situations

### Gameplay mechanics

- Everyday concept for discussing gameplay
- mixes different types of concepts (components, actions, goals, compounds of these)
- best formalize as verbs: climb, draw card, double jump, etc

### Gameplay design patterns

- originally a concept for architecture but applied in many fields
- A way to describe components on all levels

### MDA Framework

"Game as state machines" 

- Mechanics -> Dynamics -> Aesthetics

Provides an overview on the developer's and player's perspective.

### Game design patterns

## L3 - Machinations

## L4 - Games as activities

## L5 - Design goals and design methods

## L6 - Gamification

# Assignments

## A1 - Definition of Game - 12 NOV

- use examples of
- "Your" defintion -- don't rely on the definitions of others to define your definition
- 


## A2 - Analyse the design behind two games: No thanks! and Catan

- describe the games and their gameplay - core
- use Gameplay design patterms and MDA to describe the structures
- define gameplay patterns you have identified
- reference gameplay patterns you have identified by others


MDA: 

- examine
